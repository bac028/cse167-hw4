### Names: 
Osvaldo Vazquez Lara, Baily Chen, Rachel Barrow 

### Paragraph: 
We will recreating a basic first person world simulator that incorporates basic world components such as water, grass, and physics as well as a procedurally generated city. We drew inspiration from Minecraft in the simplicity of the game mechanics. We hope to be able to have at least one room to move around and also have lighting to give more depth to our world.

### Technical features: 
- First Person Camera Controls (1)
- Collision Detection (1)
- Procedurally Generated Terrain (2)
- Procedurally Generated Clouds (2)
- Procedurally Generated Plants (2)
- Water effect (3 1/3)

### Creativity: 
- Different Color lighting for different times of the day
- Create a character model
- First and third person perspectives
- Cool looking procedurally generated terrain/objects/buildings
- Have an object designated for the sun that changes the time of the day
